    <h2>Store</h2>
    <p>
        Store is a unique centralized JavaScript Object Literal
        <br> This tree representation encompass a specific snapshot state of the whole application
    </p>
    <p>Mostly, three kind of data in our state:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Domain Data: data that the application needs to show, use, or modify</li>
        <li>App State: data that is specific to the application's behavior</li>
        <li>UI State: data that represents how the UI is currently displayed</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Example</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Domain Data: "all of the Todos retrieved from the server"</li>
            <li>App State: "Todo #5 is currently selected" || "there is a request in progress to fetch Todos"</li>
            <li>UI State:  "The EditTodo modal dialog is currently open"</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>State needs: SHARI</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Shared => many components or services</li>
        <li>Hydrated => persisted &amp; hydrated from Storage</li>
        <li>Available => re-entering routes</li>
        <li>Retrieved => retrieved through side-effect</li>
        <li>Impacted => State that is impacted from other sources</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>
            -Hydrated: like userPreference could be a good things
            <br> -Availbale: come back to the page data already here
            <br> -Retrieved: Unidirectional Data Flow clean/flaten asynchronous complexity
        </p>

    <h2>What doesn't belong state</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Non serializable Data</li>
        <li>Ephemeral Data</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>
            Forms: Cause stateful, self-contained local context => Angular's Form Control aren't serializable &amp; Immutable
            <br> Non serializable data: function eval or Circular Object Data Structure, Map or Set => Router State example
            <br> Ephemeral data: Concerning state solely owned by one specific component => I know we break Single truth concept
        </p>
